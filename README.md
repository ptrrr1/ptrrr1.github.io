# [Coding Journey - JavaScript and Website Creation]

> This is meant as way to learn Javascript and Website creation.
> The sole purpose of this is to:
    1. Create a website that's liked to some sort of robot,
    allowing friends to mess with said robot.
    2. Expand my curriculum.
> That being said, this will see 'pushes' and 'commits' over
time as i begin to develop my carrer in the IT industry.
